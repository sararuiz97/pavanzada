You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text. To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a hash table ↴ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:  
"After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"  
"Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."  
What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final hash table should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of  2  

--------------------------------------------------
Save the string in a variable called input. Remove especial characters from input such as “,”,”?”,”:”,”.”, etc. Then turn input to lower case. Once the string has this form separate each word by splitting the string every time a “ “ is encountered. By each word generated by the split method check if it’s on the hash table, if it’s not add it with a value of 1, if it is in the hash table, get the current value it holds and store it in a variable called oldvalue, delete it from the hash table, then add it again with the value of oldvalue+1. Repeat this process until all the words have been processed.
